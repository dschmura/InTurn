# Phase-1 Guide

**[Week-1](week-1/README.md)** | **[Week-2](week-2/README.md)** | **[Week-3](week-3/README.md)** | **[Week-4](week-4/README.md)**


Phase-1 is when we start to meet and orient our new team members. The overall goal is to lay the foundation for building a successful project in Phase-2. The focus is on the underlying communication approaches. We want to introduce our new team members to how we talk about our work. This phase is about building rapport and trust. It is about helping the new team members feel confident asking for help. 

During this phase the team members will: 
  - meet the WA@Ds team
  - learn about our mission and values
  - get development environments set up
  - learn how the WA@Ds team communicates

In addition, we will begin learning how to shape the work we are going to do
  - gathering requirements
  - defining features

This will coincide with learning about Test Driven Development and how to "think" about writing tests. (** Hint, good tests are a good feature specifications.)

Finally, we will start introducing basic Ruby on Rails concepts and set the team members up to use the ModelRails_app as a foundation for a 'breakable toy'.

Good morning! You've almost made it through your first week! Congratulations! I hope that you are feeling as welcome as you truly are! 

On Monday I will give you a tour of 301 East Liberty and make sure you have access to what you need there. It is a pretty nice place if you are looking for somewhere to do your work, and it's available :)

We'll also chat about the schedule/plan for the next two weeks, and what kind of 'reflection' exercises might be worthwhile. (It's probably going to be a blog...because then you get to practice your html / css etc...). Bring your computers so we can make sure you can connect and are able to function. 

Next week we will also need to start doing some work with git and GitHub. I am still working out how to approach that, but we'll figure something out. 

Finally, I'd like to have you each share 3 of your favorite web sites/applications. You decide what qualifies as 'favorite', but be prepared to be asked, because I am going to ask. 

Have a fantastic weekend! 

Dave

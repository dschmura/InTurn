# Phase-1 Week-1 Guide

  ## Week 1 (May 2nd - 7th)
  > #### GOALS: Welcome interns and get set up for success!
  > This should be a checklist

  - WA@Ds Orientation
    - Meet the team
      - Interview each member of WA@Ds
    - Expectations
    - Schedule (weekly cadence)
    - Communication
    - Goals of the summer 
        - The most important thing I want you to learn is how to try. Make it safe, make it rewarding, but find an experiment and give it a go. 
        - And, ALWAYS look for collatoral benefits from your work. What can be reused? How can this lesson be cpatured and shared? How can we show off our growth and accomplishments? **GET IN THIS HABIT.**

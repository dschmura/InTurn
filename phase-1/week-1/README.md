    - The most important thing I want you to learn is how to try. Make it safe, make it rewarding, but find an experiment and give it a go. 
    - And, ALWAYS look for collatoral benefits from your work. What can be reused? How can this lesson be cpatured and shared? How can we show off our growth and accomplishments? **GET IN THIS HABIT.**

- Make sure computers are set up and ready to go
- Make sure accounts are setup for employees (github, slack, zoom, email groups etcâ€¦)

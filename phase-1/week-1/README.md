  ## Post ITS Orientation reflection?
  Teach me what you learned doing the orientation product development?

  What are the appropriate uses of the Block M? Have you seen these violated? Tell me what you think about that.

- WA@Ds Orientation
  - Meet the team
    - Interview each member of WA@Ds
  - Expectations
  - Schedule (weekly cadence)
  - Communication
  - Goals of the summer 
      - The most important thing I want you to learn is how to try. Make it safe, make it rewarding, but find an experiment and give it a go. 
      - And, ALWAYS look for collatoral benefits from your work. What can be reused? How can this lesson be cpatured and shared? How can we show off our growth and accomplishments? **GET IN THIS HABIT.**

- Make sure computers are set up and ready to go
- Make sure accounts are setup for employees (github, slack, zoom, email groups etcâ€¦)

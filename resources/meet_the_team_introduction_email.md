## Message to staff

On [May 4th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Day), we will be welcoming two interns who will be working with the Rails Team this summer. Their first day with our team will be Wednesday, [May 4th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Day), which happens to be our standup. **It also happens to be [Star Wars Day!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Day)

I think it will be overwhelming to do the round robin introductions on their first day, so instead I have devised a 'Meet the Team' exercise.

In short, I am going to have the interns schedule a 15 minute zoom call with each of you so you can introduce yourselves. To make things less awkward for the interns, they will be interviewing you together, and I've given them a short script. The script is available ** below. It is just a short survey asking you some questions, getting a screenshot of you via zoom holding something of importance to you...you decide what that means, and a little game I'm calling "Quirks and a Quandry"

I've linked the [Meet the Team Exercise](./resources/meet_the_team_exercise.md) so that you can preview the questions and learn about the Quirks and a Quandary game.

## Slack message after initial introduction

@channel ACTION REQUIRED: Sign up to meet the interns!
As I mentioned in this morning’s meeting, I have created a Doodle so that you can sign-up for available interview slots to meet our new interns Debbie and Henry. The slots are for 1/2 hour, but the interviews won’t use the full time. Most will likely be between 10 - 20 minutes.
There are time slots available THIS AFTERNOON, tomorrow as well as several days next week. If none of the open slots work for your schedule, please send me an email and we will adjust.

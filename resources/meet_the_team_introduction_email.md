## Message to staff

On [May 4th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Day), we will be welcoming two interns who will be working with the Rails Team this summer. Their first day with our team will be Wednesday, [May 4th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Day), which happens to be our standup. **It also happens to be [Star Wars Day!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Day)

I think it will be overwhelming to do the round robin introductions on their first day, so instead I have devised a 'Meet the Team' exercise.

In short, I am going to have the interns schedule a 15 minute zoom call with each of you so you can introduce yourselves. To make things less awkward for the interns, they will be interviewing you together, and I've given them a short script. The script is available ** below. It is just a short survey asking you some questions, getting a screenshot of you via zoom holding something of importance to you...you decide what that means, and a little game I'm calling "Quirks and a Quandry"

I've linked the [Meet the Team Exercise](./resources/meet_the_team_exercise.md) so that you can preview the questions and learn about the Quirks and a Quandary game.

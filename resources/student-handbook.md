## FAQs

Q: Oh also I was meaning to ask, but I noticed next week thereâ€™s an LSA TS All-Staff Meeting and I was wondering are we meant to go to those?

A: Good question. It is not mandatory to attend, but if you are interested, you are certainly welcome. I usually try to avoid scheduling anything that is a direct conflict so you can have the choice, but if I think we might need the time, I will consult with you and Debbie first.

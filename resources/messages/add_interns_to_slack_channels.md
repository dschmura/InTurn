Good morning Slack Admins.
Could I please have a channel created:

Security: private channel
Purpose: Short term channel (4 months), providing a dedicated space for wads interns and supervisors.

Also, please add heteng@umich.edu and dcjshih@umich.edu to these channels [team-wads, team-wads-priv, and team-wads-rails and wads-interns-2022]. 

Please let me know if there are any questions.

The W&ADS team is thrilled to introduce our 2 interns Debbie Shih and Henry Teng who are joining us for the summer. Both Debbie and Henry are LSA undergraduate students who will be learning full-stack web development working with the W&ADS Rails Team developing Ruby on Rails applications. Their primary project will be a web site inventory “Dashboard” to help manage the hundreds of sites and applications that are managed by the W&ADS team.

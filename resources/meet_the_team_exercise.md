# Meet the Team Exercise: 

 Our new team members will conduct brief interviews of the staff (10 - 15 minutes). The idea is to give our new team members an opportunity to meet everyone on the team. The interviews will be very short (3 - 5 questions).

 In addition, the interns will ask if you would be willing to pose for a screen shot with a 'mascot'. This can be anything, an old trophy, a piece of wedding cake you purchased from King Edward VIII's wedding to Wallis Simpson, your diploma, a good luck sock... For inspiration maybe watch a few from 8 out 10 Cats Does Countdown

# Quirks and a Quandry Game

Quirks are a nice way to share something personal (not too personal) about yourself with someone else. It is kind of like letting someone in on a little secret, but without the preasure. The Quirks and a Quandry game gives it a little twist. The idea is, you have to tell the intern(s) 3 quirks, two of which are true, and one that is a lie. (** The reveal will happen at our next stand up...see below.)

Quirks generally fall into a couple of categories
  
  - Hobbies and interests that might be unexpected
  - Famous people you may have met 
  - Superstitions (ie: "I always hold my breath when I pass a cemetary.")
  - I used to be a concert pianist

In our WA@Ds standup on Wednesday, May 18th, we will have the interns introduce each team member based on the information gathered in the interview. They will also read the three 'quirks'. At this point the interns will poll the rest of the team to see if we can guess which 'quirk' was a lie.

# Screenshot Selfie 

As part of the interview, please ask the participant to hold up a 'mascot'. A mascot, in this circumstance is some object, around which they can tell a story. The mascot can be a ludicrous or impractical object and the story can be completely made up. This is an excuse to be goofy.

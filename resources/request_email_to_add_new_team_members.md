Can you please add our new interns Henry Teng (heteng@umich.edu) and Debbie Shih (dcjshih@umich.edu) to all of the things for WA@Ds? 

I have created a MCommunity Group called 'wads-interns-2022' which has them both as members.

Is there an onboarding checklist for what accounts etc...?

This is what I came up with.

## Accounts
- [ ] GitHub
- [ ] Slack
- [ ] Google Calendar
- [ ] Zoom
- [ ] TailwindUI

## Groups and Calendars
- [x] Create [MCommunity Group](https://mcommunity.umich.edu) for interns _**wads-interns-2022**_
- [ ] Add interns to staff calandars
- [ ] Add interns to staff email groups

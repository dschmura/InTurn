Teach me what you learned doing the orientation product development?

What are the appropriate uses of the Block M? Have you seen these violated? Tell me what you think about that.

On May 4th, we will be welcoming two interns who will be working with the Rails Team this summer. Their first day with our team will be Wednesday, May 4th, which happens to be our standup. OK, so now take a moment and imagine being a first year…doing a new internship, and your first introduction to your new work experience is a zoom call with a bunch of fogies in it. 

  ## Week 1 (May 2nd - 7th)
  ### GOALS: Welcome interns and get set up for success!

    - Communication
    - Goals of the summer 
        - The most important thing I want you to learn is how to try. Make it safe, make it rewarding, but find an experiment and give it a go. 
        - And, ALWAYS look for collatoral benefits from your work. What can be reused? How can this lesson be cpatured and shared? How can we show off our growth and accomplishments? **GET IN THIS HABIT.**

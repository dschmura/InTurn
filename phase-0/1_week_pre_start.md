Subject: We're looking forward to seeing you!


It might not seem like a lot, but trust me, there is a LOT of surface area in this problem space. I am building the curriculum around 'phases'.

**phase-0:** Pre-Internship communications (like this one) and administrivia (human resources stuff)
**phase-1:** Orientation, introductions, tools of the trade and basic app development.
**phase-2:** Build apps!!!

At the beginning of each phase, I will be sharing information about that phase's projects, readings and assignments.

Next week will be a bit different, as you know, during orientation. 

I wanted to give you a heads up that our team has a bi-weekly all team meeting that is conveniently scheduled for **_9am Wednesday morning_**. You can attend over zoom (I will send the details next week). I will introduce you briefly, and introduce the team to the 'meet the team' exercise that will be part of your first two weeks. (Full description of this exercise will be ready shortly...)

Alright, this short email is growing long, so I will leave it there. I hope you have a great week and we will see you next week!! If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know!

Best,

Dave

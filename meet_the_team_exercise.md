# Quirks and a Quandry Game

Quirks are a nice way to share something personal (not too personal) about yourself with someone else. It is kind of like letting someone in on a little secret, but without the preasure. 

Quirks generally fall into a couple of categories
  * Hobbies and interests that might be unexpected

## Message to staff

On May 4th, we will be welcoming two interns who will be working with the Rails Team this summer. Their first day with our team will be Wednesday, May 4th, which happens to be our standup. I think it will be overwhelming to do the round robin introductions on their first day, so in stead I have devised a 'Meet the Team' exercise.

In short, I am going to have the interns schedule a 15 minute zoom call with each of you so you can introduce yourselves. To make things less awkward for the interns, they will be interviewing you together, and I've given them a short script. The script is available ** below. It is just a short survey asking you some questions, getting a screen shot of you via zoom holding something of importance to you...you decide what that means, and a little game I'm calling "Quirks and a Quandry"

> # Meet the Team Exercise: 

 Brief interviews of the staff (10 - 15 minutes). The idea is to give our new interns (employees) an opportunity to meet everyone on the team.    The interviews will be very short (3 - 5 questions).

 Please be prepared to answer some 'get to know you' questions. 

 Also, the interns will ask if you would be willing to pose for a screen shot with 'something that is meaningful to you'. This can be anything, an old trophy, a piece of wedding cake you purchased from King Edward VIII's wedding to Wallis Simpson, your diploma...

 Name, how did you come to be at the University, Quirks and a Quandry Game (2 truths and a lie) 
[Quirks example](http://dragon.sleepdeprived.ca/games/icebreaker/icebreaker_16.htm)

 * What do you like to be called?
 * Tell me how you came to be at the University of Michigan.
 * Tweet-sized peice of advice.
 * Quirks and a Quandry Game

-- Maybe?
* If there were one person I should meet in LSATS (not WA@Ds team) who would it be and why?


# Quirks and a Quandry Game

Quirks are a nice way to share something personal (not too personal) about yourself with someone else. It is kind of like letting someone in on a little secret, but without the preasure. The Quirks and a Quandry game gives it a little twist. The idea is, you have to tell the intern(s) 3 quirks, two of which are true, and one that is a lie. (** The reveal will happen at our next stand up...see below.)

Quirks generally fall into a couple of categories
  *Â Hobbies and interests that might be unexpected
  * Famous people you may have met 
  * 

In our WA@Ds standup on Wednesday, May 18th, we will have the interns introduce each team member based on the information gathered in the interview. They will also read the three 'quirks'. At this point the interns will pole the rest of the team to see if we can guess which 'quirk' was a lie.

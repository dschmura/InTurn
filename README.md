# Welcome to the InTurn Bootcamp 

The InTurn Bootcamp is a repository to manage resources related to recruiting, onboarding and training interns and student workers. These resources can be mixed and matched and customized as needed (fork the repo), but this repository is the basis. 

The repository is broken down into 4 main sections, Recruitment, Phase-0, Phase-1, Phase-2.

  * basic skill leveling: Trying to assess and 
  * communication norms


* Phase 1 - Orientation, introductions, tools of the trade and basic app development.
  

* Phase 2 - advanced app development, release project, presentations
